# TortoiseTTS GUI
## What is this?
This is a gradio GUI to make it easier to use [Tortoise TTS](https://github.com/neonbjb/tortoise-tts)

You can find guides and demo colab link in there. I've yet to make a colab to include the gui but it should be fairly easy.

## What does this repo include?
The gradioUI I've written in python and a simple middleman script I've created to make it easier to interact with the api.

## Installation
Follow the installation guide here [Tortoise Local Installation](https://github.com/neonbjb/tortoise-tts#local-installation) then simply put the files in the root directors, create a shell there and run gradeui.py

## What's up with the voice selections?
Those are just the voices I've made myself, unfortunately I don't want to be hold liable publishing anyone elses voice on GitHub so you need to find recordings of the voices of the people you want to use yourself.
